# Blockchain Voting System

## Project Overview
This is a decentralized blockchain-based voting system implemented using Solidity for smart contracts and Node.js for the backend. The project provides a secure and transparent way to conduct voting using Ethereum blockchain technology.

## Features
- **Smart Contract Deployment:** Deployed using `deploy.js` with the dynamic contract address stored in `contractAddress.txt`.
- **Frontend Interface:** The compressed frontend folder `frnt_end.zip` contains the user interfaces for voting and candidate management.
- **Command-Line Interaction:** Use `Steps.txt` to interact with the deployed smart contract.
- **Dynamic Candidate Management:** Convert candidate names to `bytes32` and cast votes via the smart contract.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate MongoDB for dynamic authentication.
- Enhance the frontend with a responsive design.
